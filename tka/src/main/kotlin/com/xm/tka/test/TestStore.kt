/**
 * A testable runtime for a reducer.
 *
 * This object aids in writing expressive and exhaustive tests for features built in the
 * Composable Architecture. It allows you to send a sequence of actions to the store, and each
 * step of the way you must assert exactly how state changed, and how effect emissions were fed
 * back into the system.
 *
 * There are multiple ways the test store forces you to exhaustively assert on how your feature
 * behaves:
 * * After each action is sent you must describe precisely how the state changed from before the
 *   action was sent to after it was sent.
 *   If even the smallest piece of data differs the test will fail. This guarantees that you are
 *   proving you know precisely how the state of the system changes.
 * * Sending an action can sometimes cause an effect to be executed, and if that effect emits an
 *   action that is fed back into the system, you **must** explicitly assert that you expect to
 *   receive that action from the effect, _and_ you must assert how state changed as a result.
 *   If you try to send another action before you have handled all effect emissions the assertion
 *   will fail. This guarantees that you do not accidentally forget about an effect emission, and
 *   that the sequence of steps you are describing will mimic how the application behaves in
 *   reality.
 * * All effects must complete by the time the assertion has finished running the steps you
 *   specify.
 *   If at the end of the assertion there is still an in-flight effect running, the assertion
 *   will fail. This helps exhaustively prove that you know what effects are in flight and forces
 *   you to prove that effects will not cause any future changes to your state.
