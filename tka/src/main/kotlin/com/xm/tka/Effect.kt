/**
 * The `Effect` type encapsulates a unit of work that can be run in the outside world, and can feed
 * data back to the `Store`. It is the perfect place to do side effects, such as network requests,
 * saving/loading from disk, creating timers, interacting with dependencies, and more.
 *
 * Effects are returned from reducers so that the `Store` can perform the effects after the reducer
 * is done running. It is important to note that `Store` is not thread safe, and so all effects
 * must receive values on the same thread, **and** if the store is being used to drive UI then it
 * must receive values on the main thread.
 *
 * An effect simply wraps a `Publisher` value and provides some convenience initializers for
 * constructing some common types of effects.
